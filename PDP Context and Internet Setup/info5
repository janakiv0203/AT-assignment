A PDP (Packet Data Protocol) context is configured to enable internet connectivity over a cellular modem (GSM/3G/4G). 
This is done using the AT+CGDCONT command, which defines how the modem connects to the mobile network for data services. 
The most essential component of this configuration is the Access Point Name (APN), which is provided by the mobile network operator of the SIM card.
The AT+CGDCONT command is used to define a PDP context. The basic syntax is: AT+CGDCONT=<cid>,<PDP_type>,<APN>[,<PDP_addr>[,<d_comp>,<h_comp>]]
•	<cid> is the context ID, typically set to 1.
•	<PDP_type> defines the protocol, usually "IP" or "IPV6".
•	<APN> is the network’s APN name (e.g., "airtelgprs.com").
•	<PDP_addr> can be left empty for dynamic IP.
•	<d_comp> and <h_comp> handle compression, usually set to 0.
